      <h1>What is League of Legends</h1>
      <p>
        League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009
        multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by
        Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for
        Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in
        the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, the game has been
        free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character
        customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS. In
        the game, two teams of five players battle in player versus player
        combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of
        the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique
        abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become
        more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and
        purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In the game's main mode,
        Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and
        destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within. League of
        Legends received generally positive reviews; critics highlighted its
        accessibility, character designs, and production value. The game's long
        lifespan has resulted in a critical reappraisal, with reviews trending
        positively. The negative and abusive in-game behavior of its players,
        criticized since early in the game's lifetime, persists despite Riot's
        attempts to fix the problem. In 2019, the game regularly peaked at eight
        million concurrent players, and its popularity has led to tie-ins such
        as music videos, comic books, short stories, and an animated series,
        Arcane. Its success has also spawned several spin-off video games,
        including a mobile version, a digital collectible card game and a
        turn-based role-playing game, among others. A massively multiplayer
        online role-playing game based on the property is in development. The
        game is often cited as the world's largest esport, with an international
        competitive scene composed of 12 leagues. The domestic leagues culminate
        in the annual League of Legends World Championship. The 2019
        championship had over 100 million unique viewers, peaking at a
        concurrent viewership of 44 million. Domestic and international events
        have been broadcast on livestreaming websites such as Twitch, YouTube,
        Bilibili, as well as cable television sports channel ESPN.

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <p>
        League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game in
        which the player controls a character ("champion") with a set of unique
        abilities from an isometric perspective.[2][3] As of April 2021, there
        are 155 champions available to play.[4] Over the course of a match,
        champions gain levels by accruing experience points (XP) through killing
        enemies.[5] Items also increase champions' strength,[6] and are bought
        with gold, which players accrue passively over time and earn actively by
        defeating the opposing team's minions,[2] champions, or defensive
        structures.[5][6] In the main game mode, Summoner's Rift, items are
        purchased through a shop menu available to players only when their
        champion is in the team's base.[2] Each match is discrete; levels and
        items do not transfer from one match to another.[7]

      <h3>Summoner's Rift</h3>
      <img class="img-text" src="../assets/images/oculus.jpeg" alt="VR" />
      <p>
        Summoner's Rift is the flagship game mode of League of Legends and the
        most prominent in professional-level play.[8][9][10] The mode has a
        ranked competitive ladder; a matchmaking system determines a player's
        skill level and generates a starting rank from which they can climb.
        There are nine tiers; the least skilled are Iron, Bronze, and Silver,
        and the highest are Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger.[11][a] Two
        teams of five players compete to destroy the opposing team's "Nexus",
        which is guarded by the enemy champions and defensive structures known
        as "turrets".[13] Each team's Nexus is located in their base, where
        players start the game or reappear after death.[13] Non-player
        characters known as minions are generated from each team's Nexus and
        advance towards the enemy base along three lanes guarded by turrets:
        top, middle, and bottom.[14] Each team's base contains three
        "inhibitors", one behind the third tower from the center of each lane.
        Destroying one of the enemy team's inhibitors causes stronger allied
        minions to spawn in that lane, and allows the attacking team to damage
        the enemy Nexus and the two turrets guarding it.[15] The regions in
        between the lanes are collectively known as the "jungle", which is
        inhabited by "monsters" that, like minions, respawn at regular
        intervals. Like minions, monsters provide gold and XP when killed.[16]
        Another, more powerful class of monster resides within the river that
        separates each team's jungle.[17] These monsters require multiple
        players to defeat and grant special abilities to their slayers' team.
        For example, teams can gain a powerful allied unit after killing the
        Rift Herald, permanent strength boosts by killing dragons, and stronger,
        more durable minions by killing Baron Nashor.[18] Summoner's Rift
        matches can last from as little as 15 minutes to over an hour.[19]
        Although the game does not enforce where players may go, conventions
        have arisen over the game's lifetime: typically one player goes in the
        top lane, one in the middle lane, one in the jungle, and two in the
        bottom lane. Players in a lane kill minions to accumulate gold and XP
        (termed "farming") and try to prevent their opponent from doing the
        same. A fifth champion, known as a "jungler", farms the jungle monsters
        and, when powerful enough, assists their teammates in a lane.
